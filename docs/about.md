- Started dancing at the age of 2 (England, Greenwich): classical ballet, highland, Irish dance
- Moved to Edmonton, continued classical ballet, highland and started some studio jazz
- Moved back to England, Orpington, continued with classical ballet, studio jazz and started tap
- Moved back to Canada, Calgary. Danced at Dance Spectrum Inc for 6 months: classical ballet, studio jazz and tap
- Changed studios to Alive Danceworks for a year. Classical ballet and started jazz acro
- Moved away from competitive dance… didn’t like the environment
- Moved to Alberta Ballet. Started in their Flex recreation program for a year (1 night a week dancing). Teacher was Miss Rutten 
- The next year I moved up to 3 nights a week doing ballet (1 night with Miss Rutten, 2 with Ms Coleman). Started modern dance training too (LOTS of Graham technique)… teacher is Ms Sudds
- Continued to train 3 nights a week with Ms Coleman and Ms Sudds until I was in highschool (I had a few other teachers in this time like Ms Lewis and Ms Dahlsiede)
- I also started assistant teaching with Ms Dahlsiede at this time… she kinda took me under her wing in terms of pedagogy and teaching dance 
- I started pointe work and moved up the next level in ballet at the end of grade 8, start of grade 9… now Ms Crothers is my teacher (evil). This is when I started to develop disordered eating. 
- Before Ms Crothers, most of my classical ballet training was through the Cecchetti method… after I started to work in RAD method and a TINY bit of Vaganova
- THEEEEEEN, I auditioned for the PVA program at Central Memorial in grade 9, the WEEK before everything closed because of Covid.
- I got in and made so many friends and connections. Ms Preston was a big part of my time there, as was Ms Stone and Ms Demers.
- We were able to do lots of creation and compositional classes. Before Ms Stone left Central in grade 11, she told me that I should seriously consider going to university for dance. This is when I started looking into going to school for dance in post secondary. 
- In PVA I learnt a plethora of dance styles: classical ballet, neo-classical ballet, contemporary ballet, contemporary, modern (Graham, Limone, Horton and Cunningham technique), West-African (Specifically Guinea and Ghana), - - Fosse style jazz, Vernacular jazz, Cuban-Jazz, DJD style jazz (repertoire), swing, Swedish and American style Lindy-- -Hop, Vogue, Waacking, House, Popping, Locking, Hip Hop, Breaking, tap, musical theatre, Bollywood and Body Percussion. I was able to work with choreographers in our community LIKKKKKEEEEE: Lisa LaTouche (tap and body percussion), Apple Rose Suit (breaking), Vishal ***idk last name*** (bollywood), illFX choreographers like Edgar El Reyes and Katherine Burrows (hip hop and vogue), and DJD choreographers like Katherine Hayward (vernacular jazz) and Ingrid Cespedes Diaz (Afro-Cuban)
- In highschool I started to work on RAD exams. I completed my Intermediate Foundations, Intermediate and Advanced One exams. Ms Thompson also began to teach me the RAD work in about grade 11. 
- My modern teachers also changed. I started with Ms Sudds and then I had Ms Katerina and then Ms Mah. I am still in contact with these three teachers but in a more professional sense (Jocelyn Mah is actually my friend now! And she was trained by Ms Preston too!)
- I also began assisting jazz classes with Sarah Wolf who went through the PVA program with Ms Preston too lol
- I ALSOOOOO did a PD summer intensive at ABS where I got to work closely with Edmund Stripe
- In grade 12 I started teaching at the Silver Springs Community Center… Ms Preston got me in contact with the owner and so I started teaching preschoolers and ballet classes
- I decided to audition for the dance program at U of C. Since being in U of C I have worked with many dance educators: Andrea Downie (contemporary, dance anatomy, dance pedagogy, CI training, Safe Dance training), Alen Martel (dance theory, dance history, co-owner of PIVOT), Tara Wilson (hip hop, dance history, owner of Pulse Studios), Melanie Kleotzel (contemporary, choreographer classes, owner of the company kleotzel&co.), Marie France Fornier (contemporary, choreographer classes, owner of FornierStageWorks), Deanna Witwer (contemporary, flying low technique… actually besties with Ainsley Sudds my old Modern teacher), Wojciech Mochniej (contemporary, improv classes, dance and the camera, dance production and co-owner of w&m and w&m2), Heather Ware (contemporary teacher), Sarah Kenny (Safe Dance, dance science, dance and kinese), Sandra Lamouche (Indigenous dance), Ingrid Cespedes Diaz (ballet, jazz)
